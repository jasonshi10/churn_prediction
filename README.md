# Churn Prediction

## Goal
- Identify current users who will churn
- Make actionable plans to prevent users from churn

## Data
- 50,000 data entries with 11 features

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Proposal
- Because Average Distance has such a high impact on whether a user will churn or not, we suggest your company reward far-traveling users by making long trips cheaper per mile. This can be subsidized through making short trips more expensive.

- We suggest your company cater towards new adopters, because they more trips they take in the first 30 days, the less likely they will churn. One suggestion is to notify them so they can get to work on time.
